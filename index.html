                <p>We believe in the open source community and we, like many other agencies in the industry, depend on open source projects (e.g. jQuery, Apache) to provide the best development solutions for our clients. Our goal is to create a collaborative environment in which our projects can contribute to, as well as benefit from, the development community.</p>

                        <p>Using ndebug you can easily launch the Google Chrome developer tools to interactively debug your Node.js scripts while they run, providing a very pleasant and extremely producitive debugging workflow.</p>
                        <p>Under the hood, ndebug leverages the excellent node-inspector which handles all the complexity of connecting the Chrome developer tools to your running Node process. ndebug simply automates the otherwise combersome multi-step process normally required when using node-inspector by itself.</p>

                        <p>Following a style guide helps fulfill these requirements. When our code is cohesive it is easier to read and navigate; there is less friction in collaboration and innovation can flourish.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of our style guides is not to strictly enforce one way of writing code, but rather to provide a mostly agreed-upon approach. A project's developer lead or architect has the freedom to deviate from these standards when appropriate.</p>

                        <p>Backbone.Rebar extends the Backbone.js library with view transitions, subviews, view mediators, local storage for sync, dynamic route definitions, controllers, and a simple log wrapper. Backbone.Rebar is only 3.13kB minified and gzipped with no other dependencies being added to Backbone.</p>
